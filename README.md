    ```javascript
    import express from 'express';
    import cors from 'cors';
    import fetch from 'node-fetch'; 
    import dotenv from 'dotenv';

    dotenv.config();

    const app = express();

    const API_KEY = process.env.VITE_API_KEY;
    const pageSize = 21;
    const page = 1;
    const country = 'us';

    app.get('/api/news', async (req, res) => {
        const { category } = req.query;
        try {
            let url = `https://newsapi.org/v2/top-headlines?country=${country}&apiKey=${API_KEY}&page=${page}&pageSize=${pageSize}`;
